# Async-Patterns-in-Node.js

This is the official repository for my Pluralsight course titled *Async Patterns in Node.js*. 
The *master* branch contains code as it 
exists at the start of the course. There are separate branches named after the modules in the course that contain the code as it 
exists at the end of that module.

I will update this repo below with any problems or small issues reported between updates to the actual course.

Thanks for watching and good luck on your Node projects!
